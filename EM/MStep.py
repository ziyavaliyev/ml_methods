def MStep(gamma, X):
    # Maximization step of the EM Algorithm
    #
    # INPUT:
    # gamma          : NxK matrix of responsibilities for N datapoints and K Gaussians.
    # X              : Input data (NxD matrix for N datapoints of dimension D).
    #
    # N is number of data points
    # D is the dimension of the data points
    # K is number of Gaussians
    #
    # OUTPUT:
    # logLikelihood  : Log-likelihood (a scalar).
    # means          : Mean for each gaussian (KxD).
    # weights        : Vector of weights of each gaussian (1xK).
    # covariances    : Covariance matrices for each component(DxDxK).
